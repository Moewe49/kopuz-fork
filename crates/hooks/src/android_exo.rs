//! Android playback engine — drives the native ExoPlayer MediaSessionService
//! (see `player::systemint::android` + `PlaybackService.kt`).
//!
//! On Android the real playback runs in ExoPlayer so it survives the Activity
//! being Stopped (the wry/Dioxus loop + the old cpal auto-advance are suspended
//! in the background). Rust keeps the queue model + resolves stream URLs.
//!
//! A DEDICATED OS-thread ("exo engine") owns everything that must keep working
//! regardless of the Dioxus executor: it resolves URLs, feeds ExoPlayer a rolling
//! look-ahead window, and — crucially — **drains ExoPlayer's own events and
//! refills the window itself**, so auto-advance never dead-stops even if the
//! Dioxus driver loop is asleep. It also caches playback state (index / playing /
//! position) into lock-free atomics. The Dioxus driver only *reads* that state
//! (`take_ui_update`) to reconcile the UI Signals — it is never on the critical
//! path for playback. Nothing here touches a Dioxus Signal.
//!
